Local children are set for fun and games with the Kidz club!

<p class="bg-info"> "At Dunfermline West Baptist Church our aim is that young people will feel valued and loved as individuals. They are encouraged to explore our building, in all the nooks and crannies, so that they feel comfortable. We aspire to enable an environment where every child will build new lifelong relationships." - Rachel & Anthony Luxton</p>

### Children's Club
Every Sunday from 11am our children's church is the place to come and hang out and find out about the hope that we have in Jesus and the type of community that we aspire to.

### Holiday Clubs
Over the summer holidays the local children enjoyed fun and games at our Teambuilders holiday club. Based on Scripture Union's TeamBuilders holiday club material, the club will be full of games, crafts, music, DVD presentations and Bible stories as the children learn about the value of teamwork in life and discover how to be part of Jesus' team.
