Local children are set for fun and games with the Kidz holiday club! Based on Scripture Union's TeamBuilders holiday club material, the club will be full of games, crafts, music, DVD presentations and Bible stories as the children learn about the value of teamwork in life and discover how to be part of Jesus' team.

The holiday club runs from **10am to 4pm** on the **9th and 10th August** at Dunfermline West Baptist Church, Chalmers Street, KY12 8DG and is open to all children of Primary school age.

On **Saturday 11th August** friends and family are invited to a community lunch from **12pm to 2pm**.

Leaders of the holiday club, Rachel and Anthony, are excited about the event.
<p class="bg-info"> "We are looking forward to meeting everyone, having lots of fun, and exploring the Bible together"</p>
