                        Sadly as per government and Baptist Union of Scotland guidelines we will be suspending all gatherings and events in our church building immediately.<br /><br /> 
                        Although our building might be closed Christ's Church will always be open to anyone. We have been busy planning how we can ensure that our necessary Physical Isolation does not equal Social Isolation. It is important we remember that they are not the same thing!<br /><br /> 

                        Please keep an eye on this page for further information on how we will be continuing to gather as a family and also ways that we will be here for the community.<br /><br /> 

                        1 Timothy 1:7 "God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline."<br /><br />

                        We will gather online weekly Sunday 11am and Wednesday 11am. Use the link below to go to our live page.<br /><br />
