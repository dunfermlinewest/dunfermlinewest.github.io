## Giving to our church

As a charity we rely on the generosity of our community to offer various services to the community in the name of Christ. For many Christians the act of giving is an important part of their worship. If you would like to make a donation to the church today you can do this in several ways:

* Why not make a BACS transfer or setup a standing order to: ACT: 00286118 Sort: 83-33-00
* You can post a cheque to Alan Berry
* Or pay online via Tith.ly below:

<button class="tithely-give-btn" style="background-color: #00DB72;font-family: inherit;font-weight: bold;font-size: 19px; padding: 15px 70px; border-radius: 4px; cursor: pointer; background-image: none; color: white; text-shadow: none; display: inline-block; float: none; border: none;" data-church-id="1311056">Click here to make an offering to our church.</button>
