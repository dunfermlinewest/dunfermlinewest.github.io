As a charity we rely on the generosity of our community to offer various services to the community in the name of Christ. For many Christians the act of giving is an important part of their worship. If you would like to make a donation to the church today you can do this in several ways:

* Why not make a BACS transfer or setup a standing order to: ACT: 00286118 Sort: 83-33-00
* You can post a cheque to Dunfermline West Baptist, Chalmers Street, Dunfermline, KY12 8DG
* Or pay online via Tith.ly below:

Please Note: there are further costs involved utilising Tith.ly where possible please use BACS transfer or cheque. If you are eligible for gift aid please consider selecting the gift aid box on the payment form.
