			"contents": "The Greeks were in control of the entire region\nbecause of a man we've probably heard of before\nnamed Alexander the Great.\n\nAt a very young age, Alexander's conquests\npaved the way for Greek culture to spread\nthroughout the region, which included the\nland of Israel.\n\nIt was 332BC when Alexander conquered Israel.\n\nAfter Alexander died, his military commanders\ndivided up his kingdom into two areas - one\n\ncontrolled by a commander named Seleucus,\nforming the Seleucid dynasty, and the other\ncontrolled by the Ptolemies, based in Egypt.\n\nOriginally the land of Israel was included\nin the kingdom of the Ptolemies.\n\nThere was relative peace but in 198BC, the\nSeleucids took over Israel under the command\nof Antiochus the 3rd.\n\nLife in Israel took a major downturn when\na Seleucid king, Antiochus the 4th started\nruling in 175BC.\n\nAntiochus was full of pride and took the name\n\"Epiphanes\" for himself, which presumably\nmeant \"select of God\", but many people in\nhis kingdom called him \"the madman\".\n\nAntiochus wanted everyone in his empire to\nshare the same culture, much like his predecessor\n\nAlexander the Great, and also wanted everyone\nin his empire to worship the same gods.\n\nSo he stepped up his campaigns to squash Judaism\nbeginning in 168BC.\n\nHe had any Jew who wouldn't worship the Greek\nidols put to death. Praying to Yahweh or observing the Sabbath\nbecame illegal. Mothers found with circumcised infants were killed along with the child.\n\nAntiochus also had many scrolls of the Scriptures\nburned, although there were many that were\nsaved by being hidden out in the wilderness.\n\nAnd just 6 years after taking power, he marched\ninto Jerusalem, vandalized the temple, set\nup an altar to the Greek god Zeus, and desecrated\nthe Temple with the blood of pigs.\n\nThis event was prophesied in the book of Daniel,\nspecifically in Daniel chapter 8.\n\nThis set off a firestorm in Israel and really\nset a precedent in all of human history.\n\nNo one in the ancient world had ever died\nfor their gods.\n\nOnly the Jews thought that their religion\nwas worth dying for.\n\nThe Jews had the only monotheistic one at\nthe time (meaning, the only faith that believed\nthere was one god, not many gods).\n\nBut this war was not just a war against the\nGreeks.\n\nIt was a civil war too, because many of the\nJews who were loyal to Judaism fought against\nother Jews whose lifestyle and beliefs had\nalready been deeply influenced by the Greeks.\n\nShortly after, the Greek soldiers reached\na town called Modi'in, which is about 12 miles\nnorthwest of Jerusalem.\n\nThey demanded that the Jews there, specifically\nthe local leader named Mattathias, sacrifice\na pig on a portable altar to the Greek gods.\n\nHe refuses, but another Jew steps up and says\nhe would do it, but Mattathias is totally\noutraged and kills both the Jew and Antiochus'\nrepresentative.\n\nMany begin to join this \"resistance movement\"\nof sorts, and Mattathias and his five sons\nall head for the hills expecting the Greek\narmy to return and wipe out their whole village.\n\nThey organize a small but powerful force out\nin the wilderness led by his son, Judah or\nJudas.\n\nHe would be nicknamed \"Judas Maccabee\", which\nmeans \"the hammer\".\n\nThe Jews were only armed with spears, bows,\narrows, and rocks but the Greek army was well-trained.\n\nThey had equipment and even war elephants,\nwhich were like the tanks of the ancient world.\n\nJudas Maccabee and his army was vastly outnumbered,\nbut their determination sustained them in their battles.\n\nIn 164BC, three years after the Maccabean\nrevolt began in 166, the Jews are able to retake Jerusalem.\n\nBut they come in and find the temple completely\ndesecrated.\n\nIt's been turned into a pagan sanctuary where pigs were sacrificed on the altar and much of the gold in the temple had been melted\ndown.\n\nThe first thing they do when they reenter\nthe Temple is to try and light a make-shift\nmenorah, but they only find one vial of pure\noil with the special seal on it.\n\nThey use this oil to light the menorah, and\nit miraculously stayed lit for eight days.\n\nThe retaking of the Temple and the miracle\nof the oil is what is celebrated in the the\neight days of Hanukkah, a word in Hebrew meaning\n\"dedication\".\n\nThe books of First and Second Maccabees detail\nthe story of the Maccabean Revolt and of the\n\nretaking of Jerusalem.\n\nNow when we read the story of the Maccabees\nit seems like it's something that takes place\nover just a few weeks â€“ the battles take\nplace, the Jews win, and the Greeks go home.\n\nBut, in fact, it takes 25 years of fighting\nand a great many casualties on both sides\nuntil the Selucid Greeks finally reach a peace\nagreement with the Jews.\n\nNow Mattathias, the leader who refused to\nsacrifice the pig, was a priest in Israel.\n\nSo naturally after his sons had helped the\nJews regain Jerusalem, Simon, one of Mattathias'\nsons, became the new High Priest.\n\nSimon also took on himself a title that meant\n\"prince\" or \"leader\", being careful to not\ncall himself \"king\" - because if you remember\nback in episode 13, we talked about how Israel's\ntrue king would be from David's line.\n\nAnd these guys, as priests, were from Aaron's\nline and couldn't rightfully be Israel's \"king\".\n\nUnfortunately though, Simon's descendants\ndidn't respect this distinction, and a new\ndynasty is formed in Israel, called the Hasmonean\nDynasty.\n\nThese guys get pretty power hungry.\n\nAfter Simon dies, his son John Hyrcanus, does\nsomething that's terribly anti-Jewish.\n\nAs a part of his efforts to expand Israel's\nborders and strengthen the country, he forces\nthe people he conquers into converting to\nJudaism.\n\nThis is something the Jews have never done\nbefore.\n\nNow one of the families in the region of Idumea\nthat is converted becomes very significant\nlater on.\n\nA descendant of that family is a man named\nHerod (well he married into it) who as we've already talked about in\nseveral past episodes, would later be appointed\nthe king of the Jews under the Romans.\n\n",
