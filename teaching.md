Live in the greatest story of all time. We are all part of one big story. We strive to make sense of our story and find purpose in life through the grand story of hope and love that is revealed in the bible.    
    
<p class='verse text-center'>
You must worship Christ as Lord of your life. <br />
And if someone asks about your hope as a believer, <br />
always be ready to explain it. <br />
<strong>1 Peter 3:15</strong>
