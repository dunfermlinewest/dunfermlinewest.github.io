## Sunday 11:00am

Welcome to our online service. While we are able to gather in our building we will also be streaming our service live. For more information on gathering with us please email: enquiries@dunfermlinewest.org

Join in the worship live starting at 11:00am (by clicking on either of the links below):

</span>


<b>Not sure which link to click?</b> Don't worry they will both take you to the live stream. Facebook is a bit easier to join in the chat and Youtube is a bit more robust.


On the first and third Sunday at 2pm we like to join together for a chat with a cup of tea. To join in simply follow the video meeting or telephone meeting details in our stay connected document.
