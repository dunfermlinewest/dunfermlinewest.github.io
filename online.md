## Wednesday 29th April - Pray together

Welcome to our online prayer gathering. The prayer time will begin at 11:00am with a short reflection by Finbar Rickman. He will then lead us in prayer using the following format:

1. Let us pray together for global leaders, local leaders and essential services
2. Let us pray together for those who are suffering with illness across the globe.
3. Let us pray together for our communities and particularly those who are afraid and isolated
4. Let us commit this pandemic into God's hands seeking his will on how we can be a light in the darkness.
<b>Any other time</b> Let us never stop praying!

## Sunday 3rd May

Welcome to our online service. We have tried our hardest to make this experience as easy as possible. The fact you are reading this means that you have made the first step.


The service will begin with a live video being led by Anthony. He will then guide you through the rest of the service including communion. You might like to prepare some wine and juice/wine in advance.

Join in the worship live starting at 11:00am (by clicking on either of the links below):

</span>


<b>Not sure which link to click?</b> Don't worry they will both take you to the live stream. Facebook is a bit easier to join in the chat and Youtube is a bit more robust.


After the service we like to join together for a chat with a cup of tea. To join in simply follow the video meeting or telephone meeting details in our stay connected document.
