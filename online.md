## Gather with us

Welcome to our online service. We have tried our hardest to make this experience as easy as possible. The fact you are reading this means that you have made the first step.

The service will begin with a live video being led by Anthony. He will then guide you through the rest of the service.

Join in the worship live starting at 11:00am (by clicking on either of the links below):

* Not sure which link to click? Don't worry they will both take you to the live stream. Facebook is a bit easier to join in the chat and Youtube is a bit more robust.
