Following the school term Dunfermline West provides a weekly small group. The group meet regularly to share in discipleship of one another. Anybody is welcome.

We are currently studying the Acts of the Apostles.

Our previous studies include:
* The Sermon on the Mount, Life Builder Study guide by John Stott.
* <a href='{{ site.url }}/lifeexplored' >Life Explored</a>
