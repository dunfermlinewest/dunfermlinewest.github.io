	<strong>Acts 2 verses 44 to 47.</strong>
All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous[l] hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved.
