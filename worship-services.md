<div class="col-lg-12 text-normal">
Dunfermline West Baptist church meets every <b>Sunday at 11:00am</b> to worship God. Anybody is welcome to the service which may include praise, contemplation, family news, prayer and learning.

The church engages a diverse range of speakers. 

The minister Anthony Luxton is currently preaching on The Sermon on the mount which centers on the Lord's Prayer:

<p class="bg-info">This, then, is how you should pray:<br />
<br />
â€˜Our Father in heaven,<br />
hallowed be your name,<br />
your kingdom come,<br />
your will be done,<br />
    on earth as it is in heaven.<br />
Give us today our daily bread.<br />
And forgive us our debts,<br />
    as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br />
And lead us not into temptation,<br />
    but deliver us from the evil one.
<br /><b>Matthew 6:9-13</b></p>

The series is exploring Jesus' sermon, the greatest sermon ever recorded. The previous sermon series was on <a href='{{ site.url }}/apest.md'>APEST (Ephesians 4:11)</a>>
