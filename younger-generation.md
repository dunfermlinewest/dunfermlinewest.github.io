Local children are set for fun and games with the Kidz club!

<p class="bg-info"> "At Dunfermline West Baptist Church our aim is that young people will feel valued and loved as individuals. They are encouraged to explore our building, in all the nooks and crannies, so that they feel comfortable. We aspire to enable an environment where every child will build new lifelong relationships." - Rachel & Anthony Luxton</p>

### Children's Club
Every Sunday from 11am our children's church is the place to come and hang out and find out about the hope that we have in Jesus and the type of community that we aspire to.

### Holiday Clubs
Throughout the year we run various Kids holiday clubs. Keep an eye out on our Facebook Page to find out when our events are running. Below is a video from our recent Christmas club:
