<p class='verse'>
    All the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had. They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need. They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity— all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
    <br /><strong>Acts 2:44-47</strong>

Following the school term Dunfermline West provide weekly small groups that discuss questions from the Sunday teaching. The group meet regularly to share life together and disciple one another.
    
Our previous studies include:
