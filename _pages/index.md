We are a dynamic Baptist Church in West Dunfermline. Our church family is made up of diverse people from various backgrounds. We meet every Sunday at 11am and run various activities throughout the week. A warm welcome awaits you.
    
    
* Seeking to know God, to follow Jesus, and listen to the Spirit
* Striving to reach out into the community, to serve and to make disciples
* Participating in the Kingdom of God as a voice of hope, known for love and justice


Please keep an eye on this page for further information on how we will be continuing to gather as a family and also ways that we will be here for the community.
