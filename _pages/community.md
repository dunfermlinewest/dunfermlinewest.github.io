<h2>Community Garden</h2>
In December 2020 we were excited to have taken a lease on a derelict plot of land on Chalmers Street. 

Our vision is to restore this land into a community garden as a place for rest for those who are weary and also a place for community gathering such as Christmas Markets and Summer Fayres.

<h2>Coffee Mornings</h2>
Our coffee mornings are an excelent opportunity to catch up with friends and support a worthy cause. The mornings run throughout the year and provide a relaxed environment to enjoy a cup of tea and a cake.
