### What's the best gift God could give you?
We all want to be happy. Why is lasting happiness so hard to find?

Life Explored is an exciting new way to share the gospel in today’s highly visual culture. The seven interactive sessions are based on stunning films shot all over the globe.

Life Explored will help people uncover what they’re really living for, and see how, in Christ, God meets their deepest desires for happiness.
