title:  "Outside Nativity"
---
This Saturday is our outside nativity. This is a great activity to get involved in, there are plenty of jobs.

We will be discussing the plans during this Wednesday's Zoom "Cuppa and Natter" at 7.30pm. 

On Friday we will be meeting in the church to setup. Simply contact Irene and she can organise a slot for you.
