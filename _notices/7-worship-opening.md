title:  "Re-opening for worship"
---
The latest Covid guidance suggests that it is expected that we can reopen our building for worship from Sunday 28th March. We are currently planing to make this possible. 

Please do pray that the covid cases continue to decrease. 

Note: while social distancing guidelines are being enforced we will also continue to stream our services via Facebook and Youtube.
