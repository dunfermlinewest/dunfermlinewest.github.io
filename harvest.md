We are pleased to be supporting two excellent charities this harvest:
 
### BMS - Life's first cry

"Life’s First Cry tells the incredible story of how we are helping to save lives in the
remote mountain villages of Afghanistan. Hundreds of miles from Kabul, mothers
and babies are dying from preventable illnesses and birthing complications that
shouldn’t cost lives. BMS is working with local people on the ground to help defy
the horrific statistics – and by raising money with us, you can keep more mothers
and babies alive." <b>Sarah Stone</b> <a href='https://www.bmsworldmission.org/lifesfirstcry/' target="_blank">https://www.bmsworldmission.org/lifesfirstcry/</a>

### Embrace the middle east
"This Harvest we are asking churches across the UK to raise money for our Christian partners to provide food parcels for refugee families in the Middle East. Frightened and alone, these families depend on our Christian partners for their food and medical assistance." <a href='https://www.embraceme.org/' target="_blank">https://www.embraceme.org/</a>
