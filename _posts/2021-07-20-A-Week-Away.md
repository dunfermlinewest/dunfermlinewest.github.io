The "A week away" movie was quite a surprise. We regularly watch movies as a family and have come to appreciate a certain standard of story telling, acting and filming. We enjoy watching family friendly movies with a positive message especially that explore questions of faith. 

We didn't have very high expectations when we settled down to watch "A week away" especially as it seemed like it was riding on the coat-tails of teen movies such as high school musicial. It was for the kids we said to ourselves. However, we were surprised to discover that it was a well executed and fun family movie with a strong Christian theme.

Below is a clip from the movie as they sing "Our God is an awesome God":

The movie bio says:
*In this uplifting musical, a troubled teen takes a leap of faith by attending summer camp â€” and unexpectedly finds love, friends and a place to belong.*<br/>
[A Week Away (Netflix)](https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81183451)

The movie is aimed at teenagers and so it may not be everyone's cup of tea (especially if you do not enjoy actors breaking into song). However, it neatly explores challenges that face young people and how Jesus and his community speak into their lives. The acting is solid with Christian leads (Kevin Quinn, Bailee Madison and Jahbril Cook) who are already well established in mainstream tv and film. It might even help to dispell some of the typical stereotypes of Christians that movies employ which can often been very frustrating even hurtful.

With Christian music including songs written by Amy Grant and for KING & COUNTRY if you are looking for a movie to watch then you might like to check this out.
