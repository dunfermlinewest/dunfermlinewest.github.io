We are not qualified to build God’s house, rather, it is God that builds a home in our hearts through Jesus.

As we continued our “Choose Your King” series, we reflected on 2 Samuel 7 described as ‘one of the most crucial texts in the Old Testament for evangelical faith.’ (1) In the passage King David proposes to build God a temple. God, however, does not want this, instead God tells David that He will build David a house. Most importantly, God would build David a house that will continue, unconditionally, for all time. Amazingly, as we come to Jesus, like living stones, we are built into a spiritual house, to be a people who are set apart (1 Peter 2:4-6).

> Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God’s love and keep you strong. And may you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. (Ephesians 3:17-19)

God chooses our home for us. Where we live, where we have placed our roots, is not a coincidence, rather it ‘is an invitation from God to seek God, and a commission from God to help others seek God.‘ As the living stones of Christ’s house we should consider carefully how God intends us to be stewards of our homes, an outpost for ministry. Marshall Segal at desiringGod.org helpfully outlines dreams for his home: (2)

1. **May we build our home on Christ and nothing less** A house built on Christ, is a house built on the most secure foundations (Matthew 7:24-27)
2. **May we hold this home loosely** Enjoy your home, but do not put it above that the eternal security that can be found in Christ (Mark 10:29-30)
3. **May we make our home a home for others** Wherever you call home, use your home to serve the needs of others. (Hebrews 13:2)
4. **May we prioritise our true family** Let your home be a catalyst for the building of a family of faith. A home that welcomes the lost but also treasures the saved (Galatians 6:9-10)

> They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord’s Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved. (Acts 2:46-47)
