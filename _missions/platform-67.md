Why the Name?  ‘A platform is simply a stage from which to proclaim your message – loudly and clearly!  Psalm 67 is one of the great missionary Psalms.  It shapes our purpose to: make God’s ways known on earth, his salvation among all the nations’.  

They aim to send as many resources as possible to cross-cultural work.  They link with gospel ministries around the world that share a common burden for the unreached. 

More Muslims are coming to faith in Christ than at any point in history, including refugees.  Come, follow me is a widely-used discipleship course written specifically for new believers in Jesus from a Muslim background.  It is now being made available as an app for tablets and mobiles.  One partners writes ‘Migrants on the move carry little luggage with them, but their phones are their vital contact with the world, so having Come, Follow Me on their phones will help them.  There are reports of believers in migrant camps being persecuted by Muslim occupants, even in Europe, so it is safer for them to have the course on their phone rather than a visible book’.  One worker writes ‘this is a really helpful guide for directing conversation down routes I wouldn’t always have thought of when it comes to discipling people from a Muslim background.  The course seems to have been of great benefit.’

We have an annual visit from Martin Dudgeon and ask the fellowship to contribute to their work at this time.  We use their weekly prayer update at our Prayer and Bible Study group.
