Deep in mountains, in a region crisscrossing Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, live millions who have no access to the gospel. For generations, people are born, live their lives in isolation and then die without ever hearing of Jesus. 

Many languages are spoken in this vast area and Platform 67 is partnering with a team working on the first full translation of the Bible ever made in one of these languages. 

Almost the entire New Testament has been completed as well as half of the Psalms and also a children’s Bible. 

Many neither read nor write so these are being recorded in audio format and made available in various apps for use on mobiles. 

Please **pray** as work is now progressing on completing Genesis, Exodus, Ecclesiastes and Daniel.  

Why the Name?  ‘A platform is simply a stage from which to proclaim your message – loudly and clearly!  Psalm 67 is one of the great missionary Psalms.  It shapes our purpose to: make God’s ways known on earth, his salvation among all the nations’.  

They aim to send as many resources as possible to cross-cultural work.  They link with gospel ministries around the world that share a common burden for the unreached. 

We have an annual visit from Martin Dudgeon and ask the fellowship to contribute to their work at this time.  We use their weekly prayer update at our Prayer and Bible Study group.
