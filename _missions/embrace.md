They ask **prayer** for the people of Lebanon where the Lebanese pound has hit an all-time low.  There are long lines at petrol stations due to fuel shortages and rationing and unrest is stirring again.  For many in Lebanon this is now the norm and many have developed survival strategies out of sheer necessity. 

This is a Christian Charity with over 160 yearsâ€™ experience of helping people of all faiths and none to free themselves from a life of poverty and injustice.  They seek to partner with Middle East Christians as they bring healing and hope and see lives and communities transformed by the compassion of Christ.
