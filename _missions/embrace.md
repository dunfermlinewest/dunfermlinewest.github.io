Embrace asks we **pray** that people in the region may not lose hope despite the shocking and deeply distressing scenes of violence across Israel and Palestine.

10 years after the Syrian conflict began, Embrace’s patterner Middle East Revive and Thrive are providing Child Friendly Spaces in Damascus, Homs and Mhardeh giving children a safe place to play, socialise and learn ways to help cope with their trauma.  Despite the pandemic, the programme continued to run for most of the year giving over 700 children a safe haven.

This is a Christian Charity with over 160 years’ experience of helping people of all faiths and none to free themselves from a life of poverty and injustice.  They seek to partner with Middle East Christians as they bring healing and hope and see lives and communities transformed by the compassion of Christ.

When Covid-19 reached Lebanon, the country was already in a dire financial situation, with many facing food shortages, high rents and unemployment.  Life for many of the Syrian refugees there was particularly tough, with Lebanon’s residency policy making it difficult for them to maintain legal status and find work.  The pandemic just increased the difficulties.
 
After a brief pause, one of Embrace’s partners in Lebanon was able to keep their important sewing project running.  The  women in the project learnt valuable skills as well as earning an income.  Some participants are widows, other have husbands who have lost their livelihood, or have sick children.  They also produced thousands of washable and re-usable masks to help fight the spread of Covid-19 which were given out as part of hygiene kits, which were distributed freely through their network of churches and centres across Lebanon. 

As a fellowship we have just sent £130 for the work in Lebanon which was the offering taken at our Carol Service.
 
It was good to hear through Tearfund that the Scottish Government had awarded £100,000 through their Humanitarian Emergency Fund to support the most vulnerable people following the devastating explosion in Lebanon last August.
