We are asking for your help: we are getting heart-breaking updates from our partners who are trying to continue their medical support to the people of Gaza. Buildings near Al-Shifa Hospital (Gaza’s main hospital) have been bombed and doctors who worked in the hospital were killed with their families in the blast.

With families being bombed out of their homes and entire apartment blocks flattened in airstrikes the death toll continues to rise – over 60 children have already been killed

We are asking for your help.

Embrace asked churches throughout the U.K. to pray for peace in Israel/Palestine in the light of the escalating conflict there.  This we did during the service last Sunday (16th May. Embrace and its partners work in East Jerusalem, Gaza and the West Bank, providing health care, and are involved in running Centres for children and vulnerable adults and those with disabilities.  **Please pray** for their protection, and peace for those whom they are seeking to care for, for whom the present situation will  be very traumatic and may prevent them getting to their rehab Centres etc.

This is a Christian Charity with over 160 years’ experience of helping people of all faiths and none to free themselves from a life of poverty and injustice.  They seek to partner with Middle East Christians as they bring healing and hope and see lives and communities transformed by the compassion of Christ.

When Covid-19 reached Lebanon, the country was already in a dire financial situation, with many facing food shortages, high rents and unemployment.  Life for many of the Syrian refugees there was particularly tough, with Lebanon’s residency policy making it difficult for them to maintain legal status and find work.  The pandemic just increased the difficulties.
 
After a brief pause, one of Embrace’s partners in Lebanon was able to keep their important sewing project running.  The  women in the project learnt valuable skills as well as earning an income.  Some participants are widows, other have husbands who have lost their livelihood, or have sick children.  They also produced thousands of washable and re-usable masks to help fight the spread of Covid-19 which were given out as part of hygiene kits, which were distributed freely through their network of churches and centres across Lebanon. 

As a fellowship we have just sent £130 for the work in Lebanon which was the offering taken at our Carol Service.
 
It was good to hear through Tearfund that the Scottish Government had awarded £100,000 through their Humanitarian Emergency Fund to support the most vulnerable people following the devastating explosion in Lebanon last August.
