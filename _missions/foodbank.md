Helping local people in crisis.

'The Trypraying booklet is a 7-day prayer guide and is now being used by many to pass on to friends and family with a few words of encouragement, ‘Why don’t you try praying for a week and see what happens in your life?’

We don’t think anyone in our community should have to face going hungry. That’s why Dunfermline Foodbank provide three days’ nutritionally balanced emergency food and support to local people who are referred to us in crisis. They are part of a nationwide network of foodbanks, supported by The Trussell Trust, working to combat poverty and hunger across the UK.

We have a collection point in our building and give monetary contributions during specific times of need.

The local foodbank is still continuing its vital ministry, albeit with shortened hours.  In February their warehouse moved to a permanent home at Unit 1C, Pitreavie Court, Pitreavie Business Park, Dunfermline KY11 8un.
