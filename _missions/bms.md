‘BMS works among some of the most marginalised and least evangelised people, in some of the most fragile places on earth.  They aim to bring life in all its fullness through 7 key ministries: church, development, education, health, justice, leadership and relief’.

BMS experienced much disruption in 2020 due to the pandemic.  As they deal with further restrictions as we go into 2021,theyask for prayer that they will be able to offer valuable support to all their partners, personnel and supporters.

They ask prayer for wisdom and resilience as they finalise the details of how the new strategy they are creating will be funded, communicated and implemented.  They are still hoping that despite these uncertain times, many young people 18-23 will apply to be part of the gap-year Action Teams 2021-22, with training planned to begin in September.

As a Baptist Church, our fellowship has supported this work for many years.  We have supported their Harvest Appeal, and Relief Fund, and some individuals within the fellowship give a gift on their birthday to the Birthday Scheme, others still use the ‘globe’ collecting boxes, several receive the excellent ‘Engage’ magazine, and we have two ‘link’ missionaries working in Peru.  Some of their recent news follows:-

**Daniel and Regiane Clark** are hoping to make it to the UK in February for Home Assignment, this having been postponed twice because of the pandemic.  The church they attend in Lima reopened on 15th November but the use of private cars is still not allowed on Sundays in Peru so that will be a challenge.  There is a school attached to the church, but sadly the principal died of Covid-19.

Daniel has been very busy exploring the benefits of technology in his ministry. Instead of his usual November visit to the Training Centre at Nauta where Laura-Lee works, the Centre negotiated a spot for him on the local radio to do his sessions, he spoke at a virtual conference for Peruvian pastors and the Seminary’s own conference was on-line.  As Daniels said ‘Love never fails’ – where there is Zoom it will cease, where there are Windows, they will be stalled, where there is technology it will pass away but ‘now these 3 remain, Faith, hope and Love, and the greatest of these is Love’.

Please pray for them as Regiane seeks to organize visas etc. for their travel.  They may well have to travel through another Latin American country as Peru’s international airport was still not permitting flights to Europe.

**Laura-Lee Lovering** working in the Amazon jungle at the Nauta Training Centre.   Laura is praying that everything works out for some good friends to be able to go home to Nauta for Christmas.  She has taken up some study again.  Having spent several years talking to rural pastors and church leaders about the state of their local timber stocks and what might be done to half the decline, she has started a MSc Tropical Forestry with Bangor University.   They are still experiencing power cuts at Nauta, sometimes lasting 12-48 hrs.  A power cut managed to damage a component of the water project system so they are back to manually operating the timing of the pumps until they can get all the parts.

Thanks to the efforts of local colleague, Felix, the radio continues to be the principle tool of ministry just now.  That has been a challenge for Laura as she has had to adapt her visual teaching tools to a different medium.   She wasn’t well a little while ago but after diagnosis of infection from two different types of intestinal parasites and medicine, she is feeling better. 

A copy of their letters in full is on the notice board in the church hall and Laura also sent a Christmas video greeting, which can be viewed at www.bmsworldmission.org/loveringchristmas
