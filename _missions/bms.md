An up-to-date photo of the **Clark family** and their latest newsletter is on the notice board in the Church Hall. **Pray** for them as they have now returned to Peru where there is some civil unrest following elections, high Covid mortality numbers and the economy is struggling. 

In 2008 in Odisha, India, horrific stories of violence against Christians took place with many having to flee their homes and take cover in surrounding forests and refugee settlements. BMS was able to provide support for many of these people.  When the violence subsided many sought to return home but because they were Christians some of their neighbours refused to let them move back, or draw water from the well.  And yet in the face of persecution God was and is still at work.  Fellowships are still running and people are still coming to faith despite the danger and the possibility of being killed for being a Christian. 

Across the world, bold Christians are living out their faith in hard places - no matter the cost.  The 2021 Harvest appeal, ‘I will Stand’ will be focusing on such and will be released shortly.

You can find out more about our link missionaries the Clarks and Laura-Lee on the notice board in the church hall.

‘BMS works among some of the most marginalised and least evangelised people, in some of the most fragile places on earth.  They aim to bring life in all its fullness through 7 key ministries: church, development, education, health, justice, leadership and relief’.

BMS is part of The People’s Vaccine Alliance campaign, which is seeking intellectual property waivers on the Covid-19 vaccines which would mean vaccines can be manufactured across the world. Doctors, Andrea and Mark Hotchin, who provide vital healthcare in Bardai in Chad say that ‘for rich nations it is unthinkable that this should be proposed, it is apparently just not the way our world works’.  But as they say ‘it doesn’t have to be like this’.  Rachel Conway-Dael is BMS’ Overseas Team for Relief but is also a trained vaccinator in the UK.   She says this campaign aligns with the BMS petition for a Covid-free world.

Most people in the UK feel instinctively that vaccines are safe – but around the world,  in many contexts hesitancy is grounded in culture and history.
