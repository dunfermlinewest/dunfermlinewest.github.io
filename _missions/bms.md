‘BMS works among some of the most marginalised and least evangelised people, in some of the most fragile places on earth.  They aim to bring life in all its fullness through 7 key ministries: church, development, education, health, justice, leadership and relief’.

In **Uganda**, where there has been devastating deforestation over the past 25 years, BMS is preparing to begin a new agroforestry project in two communities.  A team is preparing the ground at two churches to set up demonstration sites and in March when the dry season finishes, trees will be planted and the work will begin.

In **India**, BMS mission worker, Ben Francis works with people in Odisha and West Bengal who live in villages only accessible by boat.  With no transport running from the cities, there was no way to bring food in.  It wasn’t Coronavirus that was killing people, it was starvation.  For many people it seemed there was no hope but through BMS’s Coronavirus appeal they were able to help towards the distribution of over 28,000 food parcels and Ben and the team could bring life-saving food to families in desperate need.  Ben is an amazingly enthusiastic evangelist who usually takes every opportunity to share the Gospel but he said this time he didn’t want to use this opportunity to preach.  He felt God was just asking him to provide physical necessities like food and medicine.  It wasn’t long, however, before he realised that the love of God was just what people wanted.  God opened doors like never before and people who had never wanted to hear the Word of God were listening to Ben’s testimony and asking for prayer.  A lot of new people have come to the Lord, and now have hope.’

As a Baptist Church, our fellowship has supported this work for many years.  We have supported their Harvest Appeal, and Relief Fund, and some individuals within the fellowship give a gift on their birthday to the Birthday Scheme, others still use the ‘globe’ collecting boxes, several receive the excellent ‘Engage’ magazine, and we have two ‘link’ missionaries working in Peru.  Some of their recent news follows:-

**Daniel and Regiane Clark** are now on Home Assignment in the U.K.  As there were no direct flights between UK and Peru they decided to travel through Brazil and take the opportunity to visit Regiane’s family. With the new variant emerging in the UK, Brazil suspended flights arriving from the U.K.  then with a new Brazilian variant, the U.K. banned all direct flights from South America.  Eventually after Covid-19 tests, and international certificates, a new route was found through Paris   After even more confusion about quarantine in hotels, and hours of sorting out what was to happen, eventually they arrived.  Home Assignment will be different with church visits done virtually.  They pray that their return to Peru in May may be ‘nice and boring’, although Peruvian borders are currently closed to Europe.

**Laura-Lee Lovering** is hoping to be in the U.K. for Home Assignment at the end of July.  Before that she is preparing to ‘finish well’ at the Nauta Training Centre where she has been very happy and spend a week in Piura at the end of March in preparation for moving there on her return to Peru from the U.K.   In Piura, a city on the Peruvian costal desert plain, she will be involved in implementing BMS’s Organisational Environmental Policy, but doing it from Peru.  She would really value our prayers.

You can read the full letters from the Clarks and Laura-Lee on the notice board in the church hall.
