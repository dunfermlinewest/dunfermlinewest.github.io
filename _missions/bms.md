Over the past month we have highlighted the crucial work of the BMS’s Disaster Recovery programme when our focus on Creation Stewardship also tied in with the ‘Better than Eden’ teaching theme.  We were able to hold our annual Soup Lunch and £322 was donated for Relief Work.

**Please pray for Laura-Lee Lovering** on Home Assignment, based in Wales with her family and looking forward to her new role within the Society’s Creation Care project when she returns to Peru.  A copy of her latest letter is on the notice board in the Church Hall.

**Daniel, Regiane and Ana Sophia** are also on home assignment from Peru and will have been able to see Daniel’s parents again after 3 years.  Again theirs were mostly ‘zoom’ visits to churches but they have been busy with continuing contact and ministry in Peru while here in the U.K., which means they are living their lives in 2 time zones at the moment.   Sunday morning services at Bethel Baptist in Lima start at 5pm for Daniel, and he is sometimes teaching students at 2.30am!  Ana is studying for her final exams and her day runs from 2-8pm.  Regiane is engaging with a Church and Community course being promoted by BMS.

Vaccine rollout in Peru is slow and new variants of the virus are very infectious.  There are many older pastors in the Baptist Convention, and it is sadly quite a common occurrence to hear about ministers becoming infected and passing away.  They ask prayer for families and churches that have to adapt to this sad, and challenging reality.

They hope to return to Peru in July, though the future is still uncertain and a second round of votes in the Presidential election has left two candidates, one from the far left and one on the far right, both representing the extremes of Peruvian politics.

You can find out more about the Clarks and Laura-Lee on the notice board in the church hall.

‘BMS works among some of the most marginalised and least evangelised people, in some of the most fragile places on earth.  They aim to bring life in all its fullness through 7 key ministries: church, development, education, health, justice, leadership and relief’.

BMS is part of The People’s Vaccine Alliance campaign, which is seeking intellectual property waivers on the Covid-19 vaccines which would mean vaccines can be manufactured across the world. Doctors, Andrea and Mark Hotchin, who provide vital healthcare in Bardai in Chad say that ‘for rich nations it is unthinkable that this should be proposed, it is apparently just not the way our world works’.  But as they say ‘it doesn’t have to be like this’.  Rachel Conway-Dael is BMS’ Overseas Team for Relief but is also a trained vaccinator in the UK.   She says this campaign aligns with the BMS petition for a Covid-free world.

Most people in the UK feel instinctively that vaccines are safe – but around the world,  in many contexts hesitancy is grounded in culture and history.
