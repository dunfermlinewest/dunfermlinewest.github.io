Will you remember those in poverty on World Environment Day on 5 June and join thousands of others in a national day of prayer for the climate crisis?

Prayer in the Park is a prayer event uniting people and churches across the UK. We’ll be celebrating the beauty of God’s world, repenting of the damage we’ve done to creation that is also hurting people living in poverty, and seeking God’s heart for a fairer world that works for everyone. 

Just days after World Environment Day, the G7 summit will take place in Cornwall where world leaders will discuss the global recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Then in November, the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow will bring together world leaders to take action on the climate crisis. Decisions made at these gatherings will affect us all, now and for generations to come – especially those living in the poorest communities across the world. 

We want to bring these meetings, and the climate crisis, to God in prayer. Will you join us?
Tearfund is a Christian charity that partners with churches in more than 50 of the world’s poorest countries. We tackle poverty through sustainable development, responding to disasters, and challenging injustice. We believe an end to extreme poverty is possible.
