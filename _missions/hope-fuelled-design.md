Continue to **pray** for the group of creatives as they seek to respond to the challenge or providing good quality resources for churches and groups.

There were also resources for Pentecost and we at the West began our service that day with a poem ‘When God moves in’ by Gilmour Lilly, pastor of Rosyth Baptist.

Missions that we regularly support include:
