23 churches were involved in the Christmas and Easter missions helping to share the gospel story into every day lives in a relevant, innovative, varied and up-to-date way. 

In such a short space of time since Hopefuelled came into being, the response from Christian communities has been overwhelming showing there is clearly a thirst for high quality local missional resources that nature church unity. There were also resources for Pentecost and we at the West began our service that day with a poem ‘When God moves in’ by Gilmour Lilly, pastor of Rosyth Baptist.

Missions that we regularly support include:
