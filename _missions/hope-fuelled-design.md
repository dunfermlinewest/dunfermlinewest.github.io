It was good the Easter theme was reinforced as people moved around the town, with different churches using the same banners and posters. **Pray** that the wider mission might be fuitful.

Hope Fuelled Design is a digital media mission initiative formed out of a team of creatives in Scotland. 

The initiative was founded by our pastor Anthony who has a background working in the creative industry.

Hope Fuelled's mission is 'to communicate the gospel story into everyday lives in a relevant, innovative, varied and up to date way.

Our team was assembled out of the shared desire to bring Christ shaped hope into the world, by serving with our creative God-given gifts and fostering collaboration between local churches and groups.'

Missions that we regularly support include:
