It’s mission is to enable people to offer their money, goods, skills, time and prayer and through this to provide effective help to those suffering the effects of extreme poverty in the world’s poorest communities. 

They link a midday meal and education for over 2 million children every day around the world.

Our government is doubling every gift they receive until the end of Jan. 21 and they have a Christmas initiative whereby people can give by ‘setting a place at the table’ for a child. Whilst we as a church have never given a gift to this charity, some individuals have supported it.
