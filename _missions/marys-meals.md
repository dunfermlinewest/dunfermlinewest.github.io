Last March when schools began to close due to the pandemic, we worked hard to adapt our feeding model so we could continue to bring nutritious daily meals to those hungry children relying on us.

Despite the challenges we have been able to keep our promise to the children we feel, whether in school or at home, and in addition have also welcomed 171,792 new children to our progrtamme since the beginning of 2020.  However, the need is still great, with millions more children waiting for a daily meal and the chance to learn.

Mary's Meals mission is to enable people to offer their money, goods, skills, time and prayer and through this to provide effective help to those suffering the effects of extreme poverty in the worldâ€™s poorest communities. 

They link a midday meal and education for over 2 million children every day around the world.
