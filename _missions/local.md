It was great the goody bags, books and Easter video were so well received by the school and that the video was made available to the childrenâ€™s parents too.

The Community Garden is taking shape and giving lots of opportunities for conversations with passers-by.  It was good to have a cross there over Easter and also the 3 outside the church.

Pray for the literature that was made available over the Easter period and give thanks for those who came into the building on the Wednesday.  Give thanks we are now able to meet in person again.
