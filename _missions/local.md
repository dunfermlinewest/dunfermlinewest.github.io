Community Garden taking shape and still causing interest.  The sign Martin painted is now in place and once the seats are in place we hope local folks will fee free to enjoy the space.

‘Welcome to the Community’ cards still being put through doors in the area.

Anthony is participating in Pittencrieff Primary School P7 ‘Leavers’ Event’.

Please pray that the ‘Welcome to the Community’ cards which are put through the doors of houses changing hands will be effective in connecting with others who have just moved into the area.
