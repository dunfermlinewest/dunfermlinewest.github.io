The Community Garden is still causing interest and prompting conversations with those who walk up the road and also live in the houses nearby.  One lady said ‘I smile every time I pass by the garden’.  Martin has painted a lovely sign which will soon be displayed in the garden.

Please pray that the ‘Welcome to the Community’ cards which are put through the doors of houses changing hands will be effective in connecting with others who have just moved into the area.
