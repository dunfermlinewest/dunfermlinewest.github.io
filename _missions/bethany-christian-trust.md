We are hoping that Bethany might be with us on Sunday 15th August.  This month we are asked to pray for Kharis Court, the purpose-built residential unity in Bathgate, West Lothian which offers a residential housing support service to young men and women aged 16-25.  

They ask prayer that the young people will find freedom from alcohol and drug use addictions, the effects of adverse childhood experiences, past trauma and broken family relationships.  Remember the staff team as they endeavour to show God’s grace and love in everything they do, valuing each individual they come into contact with.  They give thanks for the new and solid foundations that the young people are building their futures on.

Bethany supports almost 7,000 people a year across Scotland, including, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bathgate, Dundee,  Aberdeen, Dumfries and Fife.

It’s integrated approach consists of 3 core-streams of life-changing services: Homelessness Prevention, Crisis Intervention and Housing & Support.

Community Support and Development projects are tailored to local needs and work in partnership with churches to empower people to strengthen their communities to prevent homelessness.
