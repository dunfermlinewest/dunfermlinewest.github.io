We are hoping to have a speaker from Bethany on 15th August  at the church. We are asked to remember their Supported Housing Service in Dumfries which has been in operation since 2002 and helps people to address issues that undermine the ability to live independently within the community.

Bethany supports almost 7,000 people a year across Scotland, including, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bathgate, Dundee,  Aberdeen, Dumfries and Fife.

Itâ€™s integrated approach consists of 3 core-streams of life-changing services: Homelessness Prevention, Crisis Intervention and Housing & Support.

Community Support and Development projects are tailored to local needs and work in partnership with churches to empower people to strengthen their communities to prevent homelessness.
