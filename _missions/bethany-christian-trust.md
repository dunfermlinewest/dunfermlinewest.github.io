A national charity whose mission is to relieve the suffering and meet the long term needs of homeless and vulnerable people in Scotland.

Bethany supports almost 7,000 people a year across Scotland, including, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bathgate, Dundee,  Aberdeen, Dumfries and Fife.

It’s integrated approach consists of 3 core-streams of life-changing services: Homelessness Prevention, Crisis Intervention and Housing & Support.

Community Support and Development projects are tailored to local needs and work in partnership with churches to empower people to strengthen their communities to prevent homelessness.

The emergency ‘Welcome Centre’ in a Haymarket Hotel is being well-used. Please pray for safety for all using it and those working there. Bethany have exciting plans to expand their work in Aberdeen and Inverness and are exploring other locations. Those working on the vans have distributed 12,000 packs of food and toiletries in the Lothians area. In the light of the Covid restrictions, people are being asked to take part in The Big Sleep Out on March 19th in their own gardens, or in a shelter inside the house.
