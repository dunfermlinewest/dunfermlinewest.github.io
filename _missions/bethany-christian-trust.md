Many children from our communities are in desperate need of a break this summer. Episodes of homelessness, cramped living conditions, poverty and conflict at home has made the successive lockdowns much harder. 

Every summer Bethany sends some of the children and families they support on holidays and ‘daytrips to remember’ at S.U.’s Gowanbank and Lendrick Muir.

They also provide employability training to some of the older kids over the summer holidays. This scheme helps to break the cycle of homelessness and find stable employment upon leaving school.

**West Baptist will be having a Bethany rep at our service on Sunday 15th August.**

Bethany supports almost 7,000 people a year across Scotland, including, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bathgate, Dundee,  Aberdeen, Dumfries and Fife.

It’s integrated approach consists of 3 core-streams of life-changing services: Homelessness Prevention, Crisis Intervention and Housing & Support.

Community Support and Development projects are tailored to local needs and work in partnership with churches to empower people to strengthen their communities to prevent homelessness.
