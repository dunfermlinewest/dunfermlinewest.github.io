A national charity whose mission is to relieve the suffering and meet the long term needs of homeless and vulnerable people in Scotland.

Bethany supports almost 7,000 people a year across Scotland, including, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Bathgate, Dundee,  Aberdeen, Dumfries and Fife.

It’s integrated approach consists of 3 core-streams of life-changing services: Homelessness Prevention, Crisis Intervention and Housing & Support.

Like all other non-essential shops, Bethany’s charity shops are temporarily closed, which will have an impact on income.  On the positive side, the Welcome Centre functioning in a hotel in Edinburgh City Centre is making a real difference to people who would otherwise be homeless during these cold, winter months.  It is run in conjunction with other agencies, government and Edinburgh Council.  Although It is operating at full capacity, the staff are still managing to move people on to more permanent accommodation.  Pray for safety for those using the facility and all the staff.
