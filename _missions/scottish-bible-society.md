2021 marks the 75th anniversary of the United Bible Societies of which the Scottish Bible Society is a founding member.  Although Christmas 2020 was very different for so many people, the Scottish Bible Society remembers it for the incredible impact of almost 55,000 Advent resources that were distributed across the country.  

Another partnership over Christmas was sending a gift pack to every prisoner in the country as a way of letting them know that they were being prayed for over Christmas when so many group and visits etc. had been cancelled because of Covid.

In March 2020, after 27 years of work, the first Ukrainian Bible translation by native speakers within the country was completed, just in time to see Ukraine plunged into lockdown.  Deprived of traditional methods for promoting the new translation, the Bible Society turned to creative alternatives.  Sharing Gospel videos on social media they were able to showcase the new translation to a new generation with the videos reaching over 300,000 users in the first month.

Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into peopleâ€™s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.
