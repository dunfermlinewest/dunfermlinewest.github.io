Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into people’s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.

They have produced a 2 weekly podcast about the Bible, Life and Friendship as part of the ‘Outspoken Bible’ programme.  It can be found at <a href='https://scottishbiblesociety.org/resources/theoutspokenbible/' target='_blank'>https://scottishbiblesociety.org/resources/theoutspokenbible/</a>.
