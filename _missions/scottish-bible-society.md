The need for Bibles in Cuba is urgent as 40% of believers do not own one. 

It is not uncommon for one Bible to be shared among a whole study group. The Bible Commission (the name for the Bible Society of Cuba) has a project which works with all the denominations to distribute Bibles to Christians in Cuba and also provide Scriptures for children and youth and large print for the elderly.  Only Bibles donated through the Bible Societies around the world are allowed into Cuba.

Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into peopleâ€™s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.
