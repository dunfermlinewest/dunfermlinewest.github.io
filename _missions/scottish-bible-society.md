Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into people’s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.

Scottish Bible Society have been providing a range of home school resources packed with exciting activity suggestions suitable for children aged 5-11. The latest is called ‘Two houses’ and it’s about the parable of the two builders in Matthew 7:24-29. The whole range of resources is free to download.

They have also created a Lent and Easter resource called Wonder Walks. Wonder Walks is a walking route map with a big difference – it doesn’t matter where you go!

Download one of the eight maps and take it with you when you go out for a walk during Lent. On each map you will find something to read from the Gospel of Mark, questions to think about, games to play, and ideas to pray about. You don’t need to prepare anything in advance, just download your map and head off for your weekly Wonder Walk!
