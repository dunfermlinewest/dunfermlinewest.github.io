Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into peopleâ€™s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.

In the past we have celebrated an annual Bible Society Sunday and given a gift following that.
