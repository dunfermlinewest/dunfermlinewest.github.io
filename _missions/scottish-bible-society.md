One of their current projects is supporting The Faith Comes by Hearing programme in Ethiopia.  A high percentage of the population of Ethiopia are illiterate and this includes most church attendants.  The Bible Society endeavours to reach these people with the Scripture listening programme so that their faith is strengthened and their lives changed.  The programme also addresses the needs of those who cannot afford to buy a printed Bible.

The programme also reaches people in rural areas – mostly farmers and labourers, who do not have the opportunity to go to church as they do not live near one.  It means that they too, are able to listen to the Word of God.

Since 1809 they have sought, under God, to put the Bible into people’s hands and hearts.  They work so that all people can have the Bible in a language they understand, a form they can access and at an affordable price, to aid genuine encounters with God.
