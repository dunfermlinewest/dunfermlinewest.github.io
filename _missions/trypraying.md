Trypraying asked churches to complete a survey about their experience of using the Trypraying booklet, the results of which were very encouraging. No one knows how many people see the Banners displayed outside remote rural churches to city centre locations, but ‘Banner viewing numbers’ are being researched.

From our own church’s point of view, it was interesting that when the Courier published the photos of Dewar Street following the explosion the other week, the Trypraying banner on the church wall could be easily seen, so many folk who don’t walk past the church got to see it too!

(Ted’s interview about the incident was also in the paper and he told the Reporter about the launch of the Community Garden!)

Their website says ‘The desire to reach out to God is basic to many, many, people.  Trypraying is a resource for people like that: no church connection or interest, but open to find out about God.'  

All the tried and tested tools such as banners and booklets will continue to be used this year but times have changed and TryPraying have teamed up with ‘Hopefuelled’ to develop an online presence which would fire the imagination of the Christian community but also grab the attention of those who don’t do church but who interact with the digital culture.

'The Trypraying booklet is a 7-day prayer guide and is now being used by many to pass on to friends and family with a few words of encouragement, ‘Why don’t you try praying for a week and see what happens in your life?’

We have used the booklets in the past and the Trypraying banner is visible on the church wall in Dewar Street.  There have been meetings up and down the country recently as people are seeking to respond to how to get the message out to many people who have turned to prayer over this difficult time.  A new initiative is planned for the Spring 2021 for churches to be involved called ‘Let’s do this together’.
