Their website says ‘The desire to reach out to God is basic to many, many, people.  Trypraying is a resource for people like that: no church connection or interest, but open to find out about God.'  

'The Trypraying booklet is a 7-day prayer guide and is now being used by many to pass on to friends and family with a few words of encouragement, ‘Why don’t you try praying for a week and see what happens in your life?’

We have used the booklets in the past and the Trypraying banner is visible on the church wall in Dewar Street.  There have been meetings up and down the country recently as people are seeking to respond to how to get the message out to many people who have turned to prayer over this difficult time.  A new initiative is planned for the Spring 2021 for churches to be involved called ‘Let’s do this together’.
